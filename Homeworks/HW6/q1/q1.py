# Question 1 - built in data structures
# Answer: A tuple can be used because it is an immutable data type, meaning that the data inside a tuple cannot be 
# changed unless the data is mutable (i.e. a list). Tuples are also generally more efficient than lists in memory size 
# and average lookup time as well.
